A common misunderstanding is that only linear functions can be created with linear regression methods. The “linear” in linear regression refers to the relationship between the coefficients, not the variables themselves, so it is advantageous to include higher orders or interactions in the model if they help explain the relationship better. However, if you include a higher order variable or interaction, you must keep the lower orders and main effect variables in your final equation, whether they are significant or not. You cannot have y=β₀+β₂x² or y=β₀+β₁x₁*x₂.
